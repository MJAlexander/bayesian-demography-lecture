## Packages to install

If you would like to follow along with the coded examples, as well as having R and RStudio installed, you will need to install the following packages:

- `tidyverse`
- `rstan`
- `rstanarm`
- `tidybayes`
- `janitor`

The `rstan` package is probably to most important but could be annoying to install. If you have issues, see detailed instructions here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started
